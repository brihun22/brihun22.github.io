Q: Have you ever raged during video games?<BR>
A: Yes<BR>
Q: If yes, what game were you playing and how did you deal with it?<BR>
A: Tf2, Overwatch, Half Life, Every dark souls ever.. any game with death. I didn't deal with it. I just got pissed off and started yelling at the screen. <BR>
Q: What do you think causes video game rage?<BR>
A: Losing. Failing. Dying. Messing up. Having to re-do Assassins Creed missions.<BR>
Q: Have you played with people who rages?<BR>
A: Yes<BR>
Q: Did it bother you?<BR>
A: no<BR>
Q: What possibly cause others to rage<BR>
A: You killing them, you doing something hillarious that results in their failure. Goofing around, trolling, there's a huge list. I like messing with people anyway.<BR>
Q: How do you think people should deal with Video game rage?<BR>
A: They shouldn't change it. Gamers don't tend to be all that violent buddy. We just like our video games. Everyone reacts in different ways, and you can't generalize a group of rage. People get mad. They have every right to get mad. Just because it's a video game doesn't change the legitimacy of the reason of anger. How would you feel if someone tripped you for no reason, and then you missed a high five, right after you failed a test? It sucks. <BR>
